# code_foo
Code snippets and algorithms I find interesting or have built myself.

In this repository I have and will continue to place interesting bits of code, algorithms, and models which I have found useful over the years or have built to answer interesting substantive and/or statistical questions. Since most of my work is in politics, that is where most of the models focus but the code may be useful to anyone who stumbles across this for other tasks. I work mostly in R and C++ so that is what most of this will be written in, however, there will likely be some Python and SQL in here as well.
